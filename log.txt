22Jan: Started "AI Engineering: Build, Train and Deploy Models with AWS SageMaker" by Patrik Szepesi in zerotomastery.io 
  - Puropose: to learn how to deply a machine learning model using hugging face in sagemaker for my music preference project
  - deployed a trained sentiment analysis model to get an idea of how huggingface and sagemaker work together (code is not included in this repo)

24Jan: Understanding mechanisms behind neural networks
  - how neural network combines different functions to fit a curve to datapoints(Statquest)
      -> backpropagation, gradient decent, activation functions

25-27Jan: Understanding LLM (DistilBert)
  -

28Jan: writing code for training notebook and script.py

29Jan: writing code for deployment notebook and inference.py

30Jan: writing smoke test code and training the models
